📱 SplitKaroNa – Group Expense Splitter with UPI Integration
SplitKaroNa is a mobile app built using Flutter that simplifies group expense tracking and settlements. Inspired by Splitwise — and born out of frustration when it went down — this app allows users to manage shared expenses and directly settle dues via UPI apps like GPay, PhonePe, and Paytm.

💰 Split expenses between selected members or the whole group

📲 Direct UPI payment integration via intent-based APIs

🔐 Secure user authentication using Firebase Auth

💡 How It Started
While trying to use Splitwise one day, the server was down. So my roommate and I decided — let’s just build our own!
That moment led to SplitKaroNa, built from scratch to solve a real-world problem with a fun, practical solution.

📦 Coming Soon
We’re actively developing and testing the app. Play Store launch coming soon!
Feel free to star ⭐ the repo, contribute, or try out the beta APK.
